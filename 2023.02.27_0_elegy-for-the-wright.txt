Elegy for the Wright Stander X out back 

I

You have nothing to say to me now. 
Too tired to greet this turning key
with the rumble of your lumbering cylinders.
Too cold to rip your start-motor screech through the curtain
of this darkening autumn air, the way you used to. 


II

I suppose you can only cut so much grass. 
We can sharpen your blades and replace every rusty bearing,
but day after day your engine block wears, and there's no fighting that kind of fatigue.
Gerry must know this - but still,
He's gone to find the car battery he keeps on the dolly so it's easier to move
(he's not as young as he used to be either).
And he's limping your way with a wrench in his hand. 
Don't mind him, please, 
As he connects red to red and black to black, 
And tries to get you to stay - he still hasn't learned his goodbyes.
