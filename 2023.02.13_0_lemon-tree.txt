Lemon Tree

You asked me, yesterday, 
if I remembered that lemon tree we saw. 
I told you yes. but now I wonder, 
why did you ask? 

You didn't find it curious? 
There weren't any leaves on the damn thing. 
But the lemons, oh my, the lemons,
each as grand and watchful as that giant Buddha in Leshan. 
Hanging heavy on the bare boughs. 
The tree seemed to pour every thing it had into those lemons,
and it held them tight, 
even though the season for harvest had come and gone.
