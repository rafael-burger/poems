Ode to Cicadas and to Kelseyville, CA

The walnut orchard was not 
an orchard 
but rather a reminder 
of the passage of time, a guarantee
that things will be lost. Under dark 
boughs and with dirt 
impressed upon my back, I knew it to be true, 
for where had my socks, and my shirt, and the baby rabbits
gone, and the rivulets of early spring, and what
other small things, as I dozed 
in the shade, had slipped away? 

In truth, I'm not sure that I've ever seen a cicada, but 
I heard them so clearly: an old creaking
through the hot dry air. 
Under a sinking sun that had banished all
but the most persistent notes of morning, 
the cicadas were a wind, a whispered song 
through the brittle grass
that collected in pools in low quiet places, 
like I also tended to do back then.

They perched like priests
and they taught the oaks on the hillsides to sway, 
and suddenly every monument was swaying too, 
in time with the rippling fields, and in time 
with the beatless, noteless, song.
They waved me a lesson
I hadn't yet learned, 
which I now understand was goodbye.
