Six-Gill Sharks

Six-gill sharks know nothing but blackness and weight, 
Heavy weight, pushing in on their hides. 
Fish like those leave wakes of deoxygenated water which diffuse
Just slowly enough to become a problem. 
Fish like those will drown if they cease their meander
Through the arid expanse. 
Fish like those do not tire or weep as weeks turn to months 
alone in darkness. 
The survival instinct of six-gill sharks is infallible.
Six-gill sharks recite a mantra that joins uncountable, 
Unknowable, unknown, days and nights into one breath: 
There is no halting.
Human mantras are not so stark - they are chopped up 
By inhales and exhales and they come out broken.
