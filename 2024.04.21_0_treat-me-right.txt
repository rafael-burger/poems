Treat me right, 
Darling, for these days are longer than they should be,
Or at least are longer than they used to be. 
From here, it looks like the blue oean is swirling above, 
Up there, prepared to swallow the both of us and 
Play it off like our own fault, or luck. 
It occurs to me that the ocean is not you or me, or 
Anyone I've known, really. 
In its depths it is more young and older at the same time. It is rough around the edges, pulling at the frames, and it is somber in its center. Somber like I can be only in the worst of occasions, like when that boy killed himself. Somber like I should be. Is it a sin to live like this? To pull so much from the ragged patches of the old sweater and to throw it out when it becomes to pilly to wear. I breathe of summer and then forget. To breathe in cool air, and kindness, and then be satisfied by this life? By this disgrace.
