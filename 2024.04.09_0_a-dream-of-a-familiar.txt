A Dream of a Familiar Factory

There is something 
in everything around me 
that allows me
to leave it. 

She will do our work 
in that tall factory. 
Things are familiar here: 
the darkness all around, the 
floating, the single gray-green wall that
I cannot see beyond because it extends 
So far up and down and on both sides, the shaking 
of all things, loud
things, loud enough that my teeth hurt, 
and, to top it off, some saliva 
brought on by the sourness 
of an apple that is not here. 

There must be something
in everything around me 
that allows me to leave it. 
Or (equivalently), 
there must be something in me.
