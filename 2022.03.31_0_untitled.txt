His white box truck was far too wide to drive on Cambridge roads. 
It's sides were scuffed, 
Which made the men peering from the brownstones wish they hadn't left their Porsches in the street. 
But they needed their "ers" after all, so they couldn't resent him too much. 
Snowblowers, lawnmowers, hedgetrimmers, weedwackers, you name it. 
He guessed that it made them feel like men, 
The pull-started rumble and roar. 
What other reason could there be? 
Not much snow to blow, or lawn to mow, on those quiet city streets. 
But it made him feel like a man, too, he reminded himself.
This reminding was necessary to keep him from thinking himself large. 
And when he lumbered in the back of the truck to wheel out a machine for one of them, 
He would savor the ride on the liftgate, and breathe deep that gasoline spring breeze. 
And was thankful that it would stick to his clothes after he drove home.
