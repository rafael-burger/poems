Bonfires burn, pines sway, pines blow. 
Rising spines from serpents below. 
Sea-monsters - trite. 
Dragons; overused. 
What happened to nights? 
Who blew out the fuse? 
Where disappeared the full powder-keg? 
Where went your eyes, where went your legs? 
Who stole your heart, and left you with two? 
Who took your socks, but left you your shoes? 
What do you see from the holes in your head? 
Stop walking toward me, you loser - You're dead! 



You told me to climb after rainfall last year. 
You're gone, but I listened, you know. 
The rivers fed each other - snakes and tails.
The rain had ended already, 
But those hills housed a pitter-patter.
Like drops falling that your ears knew about, 
But not your eyes and not the skin on your neck.  
The water must not have been ready to let go of it. 
Rolling, roiling, soughing, spinning
Circles, in that hollow of the hillside. 
Reluctant to begin the long trip down. 



Circles

I heard the rainfall last year, and after it,
I heard you tell me: "climb". 
I heard that you're gone now, but you should know I listened. 
I heard the rivers feed each other like snakes and tails. 
I heard a pitter-patter housed in those hills. 
I heard drops that my eyes and my skin didn't know about. 
I heard water waiting like a child stuck at the top of the slide. 
I heard water rippling like a book with each page written by somebody else.
I heard water that wouldn't flow down. 
I heard not-moving-on-ness. 
I heard rolling, roiling, soughing, spinning;
I heard circles in that hollow of the hillside. 
I heard roaring almost all the time, and when I got too close to bear, 
I heard your voice within it.  
I heard you whisper a string of words, but I 
Couldn't tell what they were.
