Breathing in, 
Breathing out. 
Bleeding blue, 
Bleeding out. 
Friends of mine, gone
Far from here. 
Truth to tell and
Much to fear. 
Fearing,
Frightened,
Trying but 
Lying but
Light shining through
Like underwater looking up like
Under trees looking up like
Clear and hard in a cup like
Remembering, 
Remembering, 
Remembering and then
Forgetting.
