Ocean

A breath, a lung
churning life into crustaceans, and then
A silence, a still chest in the night. 
In these moments, a reflection of you,
the moon.

A submergence, a panic 
at being cloaked in dark, 
at the impending arrival of the foreign, 
at the funneling, fast, of all
somber things toward you. 

A bed, a closing
of eyes that insists nothing
else matters, like you insisted to me, 
and with it, a pillow pressed down 
that muffles words and absorbs that which remains.
