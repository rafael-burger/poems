Silence

A car meanders down a suburban road
to avoid the potholes. 
Every couple of years, the road is repaved to 
close the open wounds, 
and every winter, loud orange trucks
barrel through, spewing salty crystals
in the quiet hours preceding the blizzard, 
but the quiet is broken by the gale
and by the snapping of branches
and eventually by a softer sort of silence.
Not silent, just quiet, 
not quiet, just muffled, 
a silence that allows words to hang 
long enough to be heard 
only once, so listen close
to the silence like fists banging on closed doors;
to the promise that nothing stays locked.
