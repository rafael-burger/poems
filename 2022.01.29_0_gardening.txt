Gardening

The soil is soft where your trowel has been
And darker than the sunbeaten surface

I would find things down there
And get pricked without care
Broken glass, little worms, bug cocoons

Moving hard to lift stones
For my mischief atoned
And so after completing my tasks

I turned unto you
You who made the earth new
But I felt I knew not of your vision

I dug and cut where you said
Placed daffodils in their beds
Fell in love with dirt under my nails

But what had I missed?
I sat pondering this
Smiling wide in the weeds by your side
