A Rattlesnake

The red packed dirt on the trail
that winds from the Almaden Valley
to the peak of Mt. Umunhum
cannot dodge the dripping sunshine, so 
by eleven in the morning,  
it is warm enough for sunning reptiles.  
As I went around the corner, 
I did not see the dusty  
rattlesnake at my feet. 
My boots passed by
close to the young thing's head
and it never made a sound. 

Whenever we name something,
we lie.
