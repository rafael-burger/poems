I'm thinking about curved lines.
Curved windows, and sitting
in the bay it forms. 
Brown lines, wiggling
up and down the cloth of my shirt. 
Becoming roads, things
scratched in the dirt. Tiremarks
draw the route from Here to There.
The story of someone learning it
as they go. 
Learning, as the wind goes
by his ears,
that hearing
is harder than hindsight.
That you can come to understand
the words you heard,
but that they'll never
be spoken again.
