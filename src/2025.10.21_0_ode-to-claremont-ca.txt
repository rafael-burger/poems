I remember the sun as it set over Claremont, California. 
Have you been there? 
The mountains
Are tall and are covered in snow
in late Winter, 
Early Spring. 

I remember the setting sun that turned
the mountains soft,
coaxed the yellow dust into gold. 

I remember the yellow dust as it gave way to mud 
under the rainfall of that long year.
I remember the green which sprung from the hillsides.
I remember the water. The rivulets
that cut gullies into the wasteland
and which conjoined to form the torrent. 
I remember the waterfalls, 
the pools feeding pools, 
the cascade,
the infinite regress.
I remember thinking that the hills must end. 
I remember thinking that it can't proceed ever upward.
I remember those days fondly.
And the torrent tore,
and it broke apart. 
And the rivulets continued to flow,
and to pool in low,
quiet
places.

I stand looking west over old Route 66
and two young men down the street take turns 
flipping their skateboard and landing on it again. 
And they laugh and they speak to each other.

I remember a discussion I had with a friend
in which he guessed that time was a porpoise.
He imagined it jumping from the wave 
and flashing its tail.
He shouted for it,
and it splashed nonetheless,
Back into dark water.
He wondered if it had heard him.

The sun is down now, 
and the darkness gives courage
to the coyotes. They know things I don't.
