Idea:

The existence of utterances suggests 
the existence of things 
for which such utterances
would be deployed. 

There are words we use: forgetting, healing, and
there are phrases: moving on, getting over.

Sometimes the things don't map onto 
the words we use for them. I don't think
It's possible to forget, 
or to move on. 
And we speak about such things so plainly. 

As if to forget was one,
and not an uncountable number 
of things. 

Forgetting:
- what I ate for breakfast
- how to thread a sewing machine
- the woman I loved
- to turn the lights out
