(Poem written without looking)

This would be a  good room to see things from. 
There is a small window near the left hand. 
it is two feet by four feet, maybe. 
iut does not have a large sill, but it has a bug screen., and it has a sun setting outside. 
the sun setting is dragging the blues out of the sky, or maybe not, but it's dragging something out of the sky 
dragging something light and young out of the sky and all that remains is a heavy things. 
a reddish thing that doesn't forget., even though 
it disappears every nmight. 
doesn come back for a time. 
when it comes back it has forgotten yestedya, but doremembers all of yesterday
s teachings. it remembers your face and everything else that matters. 
it remembers hairs standing on end and breath and a drip drip dri;ping from the shower head onto the faucet. tink tink tink. 
the mirror is fogged. the mirror is foggy and I can't see anything except a  figure in the white and the cold air on my skin doesn't feel like anything anymore. it feels like something I used to know but I can't tell what anymore. Something Ive forgotten, necause I'm not link the sun/ Because I forgive, and I forget. Why are forgiving and forgetting so often spoken in the same breath. They should not go together, tjey do
not go together. If I could forgive, I would never forget, and because I cannot forgive, 
I forget everything that I can.
