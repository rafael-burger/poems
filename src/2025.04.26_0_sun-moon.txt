There was a road I walked that had potholes and
divots and webbed
cracks with tar that softened 
with the sun and hardened
with the moon. 

There were hares too, I think,
by the way the sagebrush rustled
outside the rythm of the breeze,
and I hoped they wouldn't be spooked
by my passing,
and I passed by, and was gone to them. 

I softened with the sun, and hardened with the moon. 

Who else was I gone to, 
and who was gone to me?
