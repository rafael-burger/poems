Hephaestus Rages On
Clangs echo into the dark
as this steel fights to remain celibate
against tongues of flame and 
blows of hammer. 

He looms there, slowly growing old.
Heavy brow furrowed by the cold,
and in the glow you can't quite see his smile. 

The cold one continues to pound at the billet,
a hole starts to form and he can't seem to fill it,
Which is odd -- isn't he said to be the runt god of this anvil?   

A kind-looking psychopomp. Warmth on his hands. 
There's no voice in the wind out there shouting demands,
but then, no one appears to be his driver. 

For Aphrodite tends to dance through his mind,
and although he fears that she'll leave him behind,
as she blows up his phone, Hephaestus rages on.
