Summer in Massachusetts 

You alternated between 
Sunshine and thunder, 
Sunshine,
thunder, 
and on, and on, 
in such a way that reminded my lungs
to breathe. 

I remember you on the first day.
There were boxes, and a moving van, 
and pizza that seemed worse than it was,  
and you sent warm air tumbling 
down the road like it had some place to be. 
You whipped it into gusts that reminded my brother of God, 
though he never believed in that sort of thing. 
You showed me water, water,
water like pebbles that rattled the glass and
taught me that wet and cold are different things. 
You smelled of dirt and trees and of open windows,
and shimmered like light through leaves. 
You remembered everything I told you, 
and I tried 
to do the same. 

Out west, the threat of sunshine
and the threat of thunder are inseparable.
Both just 	
       hang.
         
An eternal simultaneity of inhale 
and exhale 
that leaves me without air. 


At The Pier

A fisherman wears a hat that says
"hooked on Jesus". Two fish 
in the bucket by his feet bump against each other.  
It's one of those five gallon paint jugs
like the ones you can get at The Home Depot, 
but this one is white, not orange, and whatever paint came in it
is on some wall by now, or some fence. He painted the fence 
himself, painted it white, by the looks of the paint stuck to the rim, 
and the fish have holes in their cheeks that will heal in time. 
The few inches of water in the bottom of the bucket are the poem;  
the barrier/window between the fish and everything 
they can never know.
Only when distilled to such
a small volume
do things become clear, 
and even then, not for long.
When the fisherman tires
He will crumple his beer and upend the paint bucket
Over the weathered railing, 
and the fish, 
and the poem, 
will return to the roil, where they become 
again
slippery and dark. 

Ode to Cicadas and to Kelseyville, CA


The walnut orchard was not 
an orchard 
but rather a reminder 
of the passage of time, a guarantee
that things will be lost. Under dark 
boughs and with dirt 
impressed upon my back, I knew it to be true, 
for where had my socks, and my shirt, and the baby rabbits
gone, and the rivulets of early spring, and what
other small things, as I dozed 
in the shade, had slipped away? 

In truth, I'm not sure that I've ever seen a cicada, but 
I heard them so clearly: an old creaking
through the hot dry air. 
Under a sinking sun that had banished all
but the most persistent notes of morning, 
the cicadas were a wind, a whispered song 
the breathed through the brittle grass
and collected in pools in low quiet places.

They perched like priests
and they taught the oaks on the hillsides to sway, 
and suddenly every monument was swaying too, 
in time with the rippling fields, and in time 
with the beatless, 
noteless, 
song.
They waved me a lesson
I hadn't yet learned, 
which I now understand was goodbye.
