Water Poem

I watered the succulent 
on the window sill and was afraid
that it would die still 
so I watered it more. 

It's skin broke and it became 
soft like jam, 
like honey, and finally
like water.
Sinking and seeping 
into everything else. 
Water dripping from the eaves.
Water collecting on the backs of farmworkers.
Water fleeing the Salton Sea. 

I have water in my head (you know by now). 
Sloshing heavy like a weight or a word
or a promise,
and, to get it out, I speak it again:
water,
water. 
As if anything but air could escape through the throat.
