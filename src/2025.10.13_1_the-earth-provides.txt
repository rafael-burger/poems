I dump one and a half boxes of rigatoni into a pot of boiling water. 
Soon enough, it will be ready to eat. 
I've got a pile of tofu in the pan next to it and brocollini in the oven. 
How delicious ...

The earth provides! 

    ?

The supermarket provides! 

    ?

There are people in the fields of the central valley. 
There are people in the orchards up North. 
There are people lined up in the factories.
There are people driving trucks.
There are people moving around in the markets
and the kitchens.
