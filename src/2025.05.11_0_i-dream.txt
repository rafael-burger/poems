I dream
of a familiar factory
in which she grows the things
that make us,
and every night
I allow myself to be made again. 

I am a bouncy ball placed at the top
of an impossibly large hill.
I feel myself begin to roll and know that
this is the beginning of something 
that will never end. 
The beginning of the last thing,
a thing that will begin to happen
and will continue to happen
at an ever increasing pace.
The faces I know are already blurred,
and I know I will never be found again.
