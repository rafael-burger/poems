Lights are on
in the middle story of the Victorian
across the street. 
They came on as the sun sank,
or they were on the whole time,
and the sun sank regardless. 
I tend to couple unrelated things.
I tend to notice when the
sinking sun brings down with it 
the taste of charcoal. As if there
was, burning way up there, a bonfire
with all my friends and they were laughing, 
and drinking up all my whiskey, which
doesn't bother me much at all, because if I try
I can hear them singing and they suck. 
And the foals in the fields grow
stronger by the day! And we fools
glow brilliantly! Moving at our obtuse
angles and blazing brightly like
torches, like angels.
