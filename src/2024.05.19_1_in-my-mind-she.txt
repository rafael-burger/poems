In my mind she wears green. 

A young green, sometimes, wet 
like the shaded grasses in the hills
of the Almaden Valley,
which I never saw until
the droughts let up.  
Permissive of the light shining through
and easily broken by the encroaching summer. 

An old green, sometimes, hard
as the oak leaves that never shed. 
Waxy in moonlight, watching
coyotes below, waiting 
for another breeze, 
learning, constantly, 
an ever-changing language.
