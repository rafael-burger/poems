I made no confessions.
Did you? 

I made a morning bend into afternoon
without moving the sun. 
The shadows shortened,
the air warmed,
and all the while, 
My eyes were locked on her
(the sun). 

She stared back, 
I think,
in her unbothered way,
but really you can never tell for sure where she's looking. 

Maybe she was taking a nap,
like I did the other day.
I melted under her gaze and dripped
into a shallow pool on my armchair.
