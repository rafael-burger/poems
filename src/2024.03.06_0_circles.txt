Circles

I heard the rainfall last year, and after it,
I heard you tell me: "climb". 
I heard that you're gone now, but you should know I listened. 
I heard the rivers feed each other like snakes and tails. 
I heard a pitter-patter in those hills. 
I heard drops that my eyes and my skin didn't know about. 
I heard water waiting like a child stuck at the top of the slide. 
I heard water rippling like a book with each page written by somebody else.
I heard water that wouldn't flow down. 
I heard not-moving-on-ness. 
I heard rolling, roiling, soughing, spinning;
I heard circles in that hollow of the hillside. 
I heard roaring almost all the time, and when I got too close to bear, 
I heard your voice within it.  
I heard you whisper a string of words, but I 
Couldn't tell what they were.
