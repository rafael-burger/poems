I don't think I could tell you what I look like. 
I've never really seen myself in a mirror. 
I'm standing there in front of it
and I can see something
in the glass that's supposed
to be me, 
but I can't convince myself. 

I don't believe it, deep down.
You have to believe me. 
But I can't shake feeling that
the things which are me are 
completely separate from anything
I can see in a mirror. 

I don't often, but when I do reflect 
on the fact that that 
physical thing
is me, 
I am confused. 

How could it be that I am allowed
to look upon that which I am? 

It should be a requirement that
the eyes can only point outward.
