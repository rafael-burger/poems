There are things swimming in the water below us. 
The murk swirls 
like it did the other night
when we drank kava from porcelain bowls. 

I'm frightened of the things I can't see.

I stare down, between breaths. Light filters
softly and disappears. 
A veil of bubbles rescues me each time I exhale. 

There are things swimming in the water below us,
and I'm frightened of the things you'll say next. 

Some things need no guardian;
some things enforce themselves.
Like oak wood and bad feelings, 
silence grows stronger with time.

Every thing I never said informs the words I omit now. 

There are things swimming in the water below us,
and these are things that we come from.
The water is dark, and it is easy to imagine the void empty. 
Our ancestors' sky was a surface with painted stars. 
I promise that the void below is not. 
The edge of knowledge is not a barrier,
it is a place.
