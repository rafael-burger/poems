On the road out of Salisbury

Scraped on the asphalt, near the Merrimack River, 
matted, meaty, brown of fur,  
larger than a beaver but smaller than a bear, 
and shaped not like a deer or a fox,  
there laid something I dared not approach,
curious though I was, 
for my father taught me not to poke dead things,
(which I presumed this thing was)
and he taught me not to poke almost-dead things, 
(which would have been my second guess)
and he taught me to shout "on your left" so as not to spook old people, 
and he told me he loved me, 
and I am ashamed because the words clogged in my throat
whenever I tried to reply.
