Under the dark lights and the
bass notes, 
It is easy to be a friend,
and the men are happy, 
and the women are too. 
And they are all more beautiful
than they ever could be.

To be courageous is to love.
Or the other way around. 

To be courageous is the same
as to drop everything 
you know. 

It sounds easy when you say it like that.
