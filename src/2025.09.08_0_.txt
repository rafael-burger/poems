To my sister Rhea, who glows like an ending;
the setting sun. 
You are the wind from the West. 
The one that blows across that red bridge
and tries to topple us. 

I feel you on my skin, 
slipping away. 
And the cargo ship passes under us,
bellowing through the fog. 
It's hard to tell between the mist
and the waves,
and the Pacific stretches from here to Eden. 

I don't feel like part of the world. 
Rather, I feel it coming at me quickly.
It hasn't arrived yet. 
There is an unbroken line
between me 
and everything that will ever happen.
Nothing can stop it: 
the impending arrival of the foreign.
The funneling, 
fast,
of all somber things toward me.
