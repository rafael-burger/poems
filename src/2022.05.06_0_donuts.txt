Donuts
I could see the dust sinking low,
A reminder of dark winds that tore across the plain. 
Those winds are gone now. 
The new ones are brighter and do not cut so deep. 
He and her and he and I trotted across the rubble 
       (sorry, no: he and her and I. I mustn't fib),
and I tripped often for staring at the orange that faded to grey on the horizon. 
Sodom is beautiful this time of year. 
But you couldn't shake that feeling, could you? 
A threat of hellfire looming in that sky flung wide
that weighed on your neck like a medallion. 
It made me long for donuts in Barstow,
back when the road was fresh on our tires.
