Self Portrait as a Machinist's Hammer

I was so proud of you - 
I spent a day polishing your neck alone, 
And anchored your head to it so firmly that it would never come off. 
I gave you two faces, one soft and one hard, 
So that you could choose to be gentle, 
But you knew what a gentle hammer is good for, 
So you tried to become something else. 

You turned the music on and danced. 
You grew your hair out. 
Do you remember your hair? 
Do you remember how quick you were to crop it short 
When things got bad? 
It was like cutting the power lines because
You couldn't bear to hear that music playing for another second, 
And then the music was gone and in its place was the whirring of gears, 
Which hurt your ears and you wanted it to stop but it ran on diesel 
And didn't mind things like power outages.  

I'm sorry - I should have given you two soft faces, 
So you would have been truly useless, 
And would have known not to switch the music off.
