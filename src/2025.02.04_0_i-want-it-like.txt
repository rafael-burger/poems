I want it like driving
down the wrong way on a fucking one way. 
I want it like all the almonds baking
in the sun next to the five. 
I want it like seeing her there
and knowing she didn't remember my name. 
Or hoping. 
I want it like her hands on my back
all those years ago
and like the day that I left. 

I want it like the day that I left, 
before I realized what leaving means. 

I want it like my brothers and sisters, 
who I love and will lose. 

I want it like sunlight and sea spray and the winding
roads in the mountains that speak in whispers,
saying something about memory.

I want it like the day that I left before
I realized that the Ocean Beach fire pits
close during the winter months and 
that leaving her would feel the same 
as dying.
