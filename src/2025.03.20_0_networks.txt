The term "network" brings to mind 
spiders,
but without elegance, 
and without integrity. 
Unless integrity means
strength -- unless it means
lastingness, concrete. 
Unless it means the miles-long 
factory. This web,
engraved into the land.
The things we make have roots!
Deep roots (deeper 
than can be pulled out cleanly). 
Monstrous tendrils that fracture 
and always leave threads in place. 
Roots that you can't worm out
no matter how hard or soft you pull. 

I am increasingly aware of time
and its scarcity. 
Each day, the places I live
turn blurrier like a broken camera
or forgotten glasses.
I have trouble 
marking the place where the sky
turns into the land (which worries me). 
I think the saying goes:
Those who march to the horizon
had better know where to aim.

Riddle: What is the difference 
between people
and a population?
