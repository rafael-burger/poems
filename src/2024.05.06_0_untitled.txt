I feel,
Again,
To be at the edge of something too deep, 
Whose bottom I cannot see, and I know 
That I must jump. 
The time for goodbyes comes as a surprise
No matter how far in advance 
You see it coming.   
Like a whack-a-mole or a sunrise, 
the arrival of the inevitable
still leaves marks. 
To be bad is nothing, 
To be good is nothing. 
To be is all. As long as 
Experience reigns, 
I have no quarrel.
