In Thanks of Rainfall

The rain has hammered hard this year - 
I'm sure you've seen the green in those hills. 

Climb them. 
Travel quiet as tigers, and twice as quickly, 
And you might glimpse: 
waterfalls feeding waterfalls;	    infinite regress. 
You say these hills have an end. 
that the falls must have an end too. 
So, leave it all here: 
	your water,
	your hiking poles, 
	your mother and father, 
	your so-stubborn sense of solemnity. 
You can pick it up on the way down. 

Walk alongside terraced pools feeding pools, 
rowdy and roiling
in remembrance of the sky-borne salvos they came from.
