A Pointless Renovation

They assembled me of cogs and springs,
Of belts and of stainless-steel parts.   
They pumped me full of beating things, 
like drums, to fill in for a heart. 

Because hearts, you know, spin low and slow, 
Tumbling ever-on down to the ground. 
But oil, and freight, and those cold counterweights, 
Tend to chugalug round and around. 

So they cried in dismay, when I died on Sunday,
With the work of the week not yet done. See,
I'd grown hard and grown gray and unable to stay
In this place with the walls overrun. 

I hope soon, I'll be born, and those drums will be torn
Through my ribs and replaced with soft flesh. 
On that day I will eat, not of coal, but of corn, 
And will dream I could make the air fresh.
