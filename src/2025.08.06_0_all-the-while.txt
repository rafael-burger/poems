Like you and I, 
Like him and her, 
Like a rainbow and the sky that casts it. 

Terrible horns curve toward the earth and 
outward. 
Terrible trials trudge forward like a dirge. 
Tree-trimming crews gather each warming morning to do their day's duty.

All the while, 
All the while,
Brack and bile,
Truckish tile,
bearing ever, scary (never!), 

dread.

Freaks and foresight, 
Creaks make short nights, 
Bleeding, blowing,
Freeing, flowing,
Really rowing, death is owing,

wind.
