Rust

Our rims, the rocks, 
Our seldom-changed socks,
Hot air balloons launched in the morning. 

Bent windmill blades,
(Everything oxidizes)
The waking-up wind and burnt birthday surprises.

Our eyes (even us!),
And the song in our ears. 
The snouts of insomniac pigs and their fears. 

Shimmering promises, crystal shops,
The buckshot-buckled yields and stops.  
Balloons from before, now drifting in lines, 
Like troops to the terrible horizon.
