notes


The soldering iron on the shelf hasn't seen
heat or dipped into pooled metal in a few days, 
and seems worse off for it. 

That bike up on the wall is the same. Last ride
was this weekend and already it's aged. 

We age faster when we're sitting still. Someone 
told me that one time. Or I told myself. 
Same thing, really.

(?)

Do you think we make the world or find it? 
Do you think I'm reading this or you are? 
Do you think you love me more than I love you? 
Don't answer that last one (rhetorical). 

Anyway, I'm aging faster than hell. It's 
like when you're falling off your bike, right. 
You can tell the ground's coming and everything's
moving blurred and you still have the time to think
fuck fuck fuck. 
And then blood
And calling mom and 
She picks you up and
You're a boy again and
When did you forget the difference
between the things that matter
and the rest. 
There's so much of the latter.
