Postulates 94.1 & 94.2, as they pertain to glass blowing:
- Dreamt things are quenched before they settle completely. 
- Exceptions must not be made for glass blowers. 

The rest follows:


Glass blown 
in the dead Winter
holds more color.

She, with the thick gloves, 
breathes
a changing season
out of her pipe;
into, for lack of a better word,
the idea. 

The glass, the thought, 
remembers the season,
which has otherwise, by now, 
disappeared.
