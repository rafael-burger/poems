Gone are the days of "man up" and baseball practice and tears over boys. My children are grown now,
and how quickly those days did pass. Not like these ones. These days have 40 hours in them.  
Today, there's time for scuttlebutt with old friends and running home for long lunch breaks. 
For kicking up dirt in the construction yard and ignoring aches. Doc says I should rest my feet,
but I'll be damned if I let a sawbones keep me from running my business how I want.  
Hatches have got to be battened soon anyhow - Who's this? Oh, how are ya Jim, gimme a sec -
for the hordes of primitive men needing snowblowers fixed, pulled my way by a fear of the cold.
But that's for tomorrow. - Sorry 'bout that Jim, it's been a while. How are the wife and kids? -
