Perhaps then


Do you think those seven sins ever were deadly? 
We steep in them like lilies in the stagnant and sun-warmed shallows,
and we grow plump as the pollywogs beneath. 
We might not indulge in all of them,
But as I stand here in front of the mirror and gluttony glares back,
A sloth, somewhere, smiles from his branch, 
Too slow to move, and too stubborn anyhow. 

My earbuds are in and so I would not hear if God cried down.  
How sad that would be - I should take them out. 
For I would like to know it all: 
			the sorrow,
			the loneliness,
the rage that must accompany such a mind 
Upon realizing that His creation loves Him not. 

Perhaps then this thing peering through the ovoid looking glass would make sense.
If I am indeed in his image. 

How sad He must feel, finally realizing the mistake. 
When your only creation reflects you, 
its ataxia coincides with your own.
