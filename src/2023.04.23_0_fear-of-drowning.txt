Fear of Drowning

A seal peeks its oily head out from a wave, 
drinks deep of the briny morning breeze
and plunges back to brackish green. 
Below, beyond sight,  
the predator swallows fishes galore
before surfacing, innocent as ever. 

Down, down, in this dark, we are not so different. 
Less sleek, surely, but in the little light we have
I can tell you are just as hungry. 
Slick with sweat, we tumble;
You lead and I follow, or vice versa.
We don't speak for fear of drowning, 
but pressed close, I can feel your heart - 
It is beating hard and heavy,
as if you were a hunter, or prey.
