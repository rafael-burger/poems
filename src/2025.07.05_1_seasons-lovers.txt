Seasons, Lovers

Like lovers,
The seasons twirl. 

Like brothers,
they grow and care for each other.

Like you and me, 
they speak in quiet voices,
saying something that no one 
else can hear, but with strong
and insistent bodies that 
convey most of the message.

The music thuds in the
front of our ears but the back 
of our minds. 

There are other things to dance to
than song.
