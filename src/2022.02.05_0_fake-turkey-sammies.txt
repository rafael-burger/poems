Fake Turkey Sammies

That smile of yours is stuck in my head
Just like the clouds that are painted red
By a sun that's already bid farewell to me. 

I pray that these yellow lines keep ripping past
In fact, I'm blown away we haven't crashed
Next to you my eyes can't stand to stay up on that road. 

Fake turkey sammies and hiking poles
And loosily goosily climbing knolls
are these days, all I ever want to know

Cause me? I haven't cried in years
But the wind, that tent, and all your tears, 
Say I deserve to sob until I'm spent. 

But I guess you don't see it that way
And I know I wont ever repay
The way that you were able to forgive me.
