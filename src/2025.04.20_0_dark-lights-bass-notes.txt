Under the dark lights and the
bass notes, 
It is easy to be a friend,
and the men are happy, 
and the women are too. 
And everyone is more beautiful
than they ever could be.

To be courageous is to love.
Or the other way around. 

To be courageous is the same thing
as dropping everything you ever 
knew. 

It sounds easy when you say it like that. 

And she, in the black top, 
tore through me like a hurricane, 
and she never knew my name.

And I, in my infinite slumber, 
stood by the wayside 
and watched her go.
