At The Pier

A fisherman wears a hat that says
"hooked on Jesus". Two fish 
in the bucket by his feet bump against each other.  
It's one of those five gallon paint jugs
like the ones you can get at The Home Depot, 
but this one is white, not orange, and whatever paint came in it
is on some wall by now, or some fence. He painted the fence 
himself, painted it white, by the looks of the paint stuck to the rim, 
and the fish have holes in their cheeks that will heal in time. 
The few inches of water in the bottom of the bucket are the poem;  
the barrier/window between the fish and everything 
they can never know.
Only when distilled
do things become clear, and
even then, not for long.
When the fisherman tires
He will crumple his beer and upend the paint bucket
Over the weathered railing, and the fish, and the poem, 
will return to the roil, where they become 
again
slippery and dark.
