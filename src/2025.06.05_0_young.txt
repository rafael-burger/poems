We were young together,
but more often, 
we were young apart. 

Young on separate sides of a white-paneled room. 
Young, learning, living, 
in a tomb. 
And we walked out,
and the tomb's doors closed,
and they placed the marble mantle
that sealed the mausoleum tight,
and you disappeared into the crowd. 

I was in Austin, Texas, 
by the time I realized that I was still
looking at the space you left.
The space that was filled so quickly
by a swirling current of faces,
there and gone and everywhere I looked.
