And. 

And in the quiet moments, 
I remember you. 
In the loud ones too, 
if I'm honest.
Do you want me to be honest?
I can be, you know,
although it's been so long. 
I'll prove it. 
It's easy to forget what sort 
of thing one is. 
It's funny. 
I'm such a shitty liar unless I'm 
lying to myself.
I say I can live like this, 
and I believe it. 

I say that I can't love you, 
and I believe it. 

And I should believe it. 

And I'm a coward, or something,
I don't know (care). 

and I remember when we were young together. 
Or young apart. 

Young on separate sides of a white-paneled room. 
Young, looking, living, in a tomb. 
And we walked out
And the tomb's doors closed
And they placed the heavy marble 
that sealed the mausoleum tight,
and you disappeared into the crowd. 

Where did you go? I didn't know
until I found you again, 
and even now I'm not sure. 

It's easy to claim that something found
is no longer lost. 
That something here 
is no longer wandering,

But there are many sorts of worlds and I know
we only share the shallowest one. 
Where are you when you close your eyes, 
Where are you when you speak to me? 
You seem somewhere else,
and I can't help but feel that what I see
before me is only 
what you think I want.
