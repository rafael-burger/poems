I will be kind first, 
before I am smart or dull.
I will be kind first,
before I am right or wrong. 
I will be kind first,
before I am ambitious
and before I am angry.

I will be kind always,
As I grow and as I fail.

A wine bar with 
wooden countertops
and people passing by. 
Glasses with thin
stems hang from the rafters
and we speak to each other. 
Saying the things that 
We've done wrong, 
And the fridge is plastered
with stickers. 
Learning, leaping,
for something
familiar.
Freeing, frightening,
The wind in the air
carries mortarfire,
and fire is in the sky. 
The soldiers on the news
remind me of figures
I used to play with. 
Our youth is raised
on cruelty.

I met a man who puts radios in rocks.
A wizard! who puts radios in rocks
so that men can kill other men.
The brilliance of our people is put to work
so that men can kill other men. 
He applies his gift, his predisposition for understanding, 
To the wrong things. 
To understanding thunder and fire,
To understanding might and divine right.
To understanding wealth above all else.
To understanding wealth! Above all else.
I met a man who lives a thousand miles 
from the bombs and who doesn't know
that they crash like waves.
I met a man who knows
that belief is an action.
I met a man who makes excuses.
I met a man like me.
