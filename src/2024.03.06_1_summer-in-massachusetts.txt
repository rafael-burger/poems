Summer in Massachusetts 

You alternated between 
Sunshine, thunder, 
Sunshine,
thunder, 
and on, and on, 
in such a way that reminded my lungs
to breathe. 

I remember you on the first day.
There were boxes, and a moving van, 
and pizza that seemed worse than it was,  
and you sent warm air tumbling 
down the road like it had some place to be. 
You whipped it into gusts that reminded my brother of God, 
though he never believed in that sort of thing. 
You showed me water, water,
water like pebbles that rattled the glass and
taught me that wet and cold are different things. 
You smelled of dirt and trees and of open windows,
and shimmered like light through leaves. 
You remembered everything I told you, 
and I tried 
to do the same. 

Out west, the threat of sunshine
and the threat of thunder are inseparable.
Both just 	
       hover.
         
An eternal simultaneity of inhale 
and exhale 
that leaves me without air.
