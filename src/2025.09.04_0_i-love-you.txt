And, 
In the quiet moments, 
I love you.

I have a hard time saying things like that. 
I'm sorry. I had to get it out. 
Forget it now, please -- it will make all these things
easier.

To my brother Miles, who I will lose:
    You are the road on my tires, 
    Fresh and still wet with the morning.
    You are the pinging of spokes; laughter. 
    Like a shirt caught on barbed wire, 
    I am ensnared with you. Torn and formed -- 
    I become the marks you leave. 

To my sister Rhea, who glows like an ending;
    a setting sun. 
    You are wind from the West.
    One that sweeps across that red bridge
    and tries to topple us. 
    The one from my home: blowing always through
    the open window,
    carrying with you the scent of the tall grass,
    the sound of hail.

And I am young again, and
    the water washes over our bodies.
    It is as warm as liquor, 
    as soft as rain.
