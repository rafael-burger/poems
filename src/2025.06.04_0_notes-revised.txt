We age faster when we're sitting still. 
Someone told me that one time. 
Or I told myself. 
Same thing, really.

(?)

Do you think we make the world or we find it? 
Do you think I'm reading this or you are? 
Do you think you love me more than I love you? 
Don't answer that last one (rhetorical). 

Anyway, I'm aging faster than hell. It's 
like when you're falling off your bike, right. 
You can tell the ground's coming and everything's
moving blurred and you still have the time to think
fuck fuck fuck. 

And then blood and 
calling mom and 
She picks you up and
You're a boy again and
When did you forget the difference
between the things that matter
and the rest?
