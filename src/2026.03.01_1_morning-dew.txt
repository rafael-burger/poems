And let's stop beating
around the bush. 
Let's lead the calves to water. 
Please, darling (I love you), let's
be, 
not seem. 
Let's tilt our faces downward as we 
turn toward the headwind. 
I hear a crushing
of air past my ears 
and I see you, just ahead, 
and your hair is blowing,
moving frantically, as if
fleeing the setting sun;
remembering some forgotten thing. 

You don't look back at me, 
and I'm glad. 
Whenever you see me, I worry
that my expression will falter,
that a border will collapse,
that I'll collect in a puddle,
an unforgivable mess.
And as the evening falls, 
I'll follow the contour of the hillside, 
a trickling rivulet flowing away from itself. 
At dawn, I'll mix with the morning dew, 
and the sun will rise, 
and the air heat, 
and the dew be wafted away.
