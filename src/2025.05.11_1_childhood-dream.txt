I dreamt,
the night before last,
of a familiar factory.

The same one I knew as a child,
with shiny gray-green walls that,
buttressed by thick pipes,
extended up and down farther
than is usually allowed by sight, 
or thought. 

When weightless, wondering becomes easy.
Issues lose urgency.
Problems cease to beg solutions.
A stew forms.

When I was younger,
I would hover, 
wondering about the things being done
behind the wall, and its noise
would erupt. 

A grating din
like metal on concrete.
Sound became the material of the world.
I tried to study it, at which point it changed.
It became something easier. 
Static like the stuff of an old TV.
Its texture would have massaged my temples 
if it were a little quieter. 

Back then, space had no importance, and
the Now is no different: my eyes
see the same no matter how far I drift,
but drift I do.
