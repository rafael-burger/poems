Tell me what I mean, 
please, 
so I don't have to tell you. 

Little trees sprout from the stumps
of bigger trees, 
waiting
for the bigger ones to give way. 
And they sway with less mass
and so much faster than the big ones.

The breeze is a 
gale
and the cars on the highway buzz
away, immune. 

The plastic heats up in the sun and we 
as boys
would hold our hands onto it 
to see who was toughest.
Our palms were scalded red and
where in one moment the table was hot,
in the next moment it was just warm. 
And thus we learned of depletion;
And thus we learned that things grow thin. 

And we grew up and we 
forgot each other and 
we forgot the hot 
tables onto which we were all partially melted,
and bit by bit, 
we trickled away,
like heat from the source.
