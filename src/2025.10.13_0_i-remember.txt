I remember that I am not America. 
I remember that people owe me nothing. 
I remember the tickle in my throat before the cold settles in. 
I remember speaking with my friend next to a Koi pond in Claremont, CA.
I remember the ripple of dark water and we each had
a cup of something warm. 
I try to grab the sun as it's setting, and I succeed. 
I hold it for a moment, and its weight anchors to my shoulder blades, 
pulling me gently forward. 
I am tired. 
Stopping it takes all my energy. 
I drift off, and when I wake the sky is dark. 

I remember friendship. 
I try to care about the things I've never seen.
I try to love the people I've never met.
