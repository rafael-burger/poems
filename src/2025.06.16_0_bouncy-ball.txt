I watch a memory of a purple and yellow
bouncy ball.
I am calm and my memory self isn't. 
He is 8 years old. 
The ball bounces into the street,
the boy chases it, 
the ball rolls down the slope, 
the boy chases it.

And on and on. 



I feel we are things
placed at the top
of an impossible large hill. 

A child's grasp fails him
and we begin to roll. 

Here! begins a thing that will never end. 

My arms flail as I try to grasp
something solid.
 
Each day, the faces I know 
blur, and I am afraid 
I will never be found again.
