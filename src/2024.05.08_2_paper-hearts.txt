Paper Hearts

During the two weeks 
preceding St. Valentine's Day, 
the dining commons are plastered 
with paper hearts. 
The paper hearts have names,
carefully penned by some 
official person, and each name
corresponds to a person who might visit 
the dining commons. 
Over the course of these weeks, 
which end on St. Valentine's day, 
people write messages on 
paper hearts to tell someone 
that they like, or love (or something in between)
them. 
Some people wrote on mine this year, 
but not the woman I wanted to, 
and I am ashamed,
because that is somehow all that matters.
