To Rhea, 
who sent me a drawing of two monkeys:

(they are happy.)

Sometimes I wonder at the wind that blows
across that red bridge.
It tries so hard
to 
topple
us. 
Or is it bound 
somewhere else? 
Does it notice us
on its journey?
Ever inland, 
Ever inward.  

The monkeys are happy.

I stare
at the picture.
It's so easy to hope.
