Paralysis, Longing

Her words fell onto my chest 
and stayed there collecting debris like puddles in a storm. 
She spoke to me and meant it. 
Her eyes said every word I wanted to hear.
Her white blouse in the Rose Hills Theatre
was fastened by a ribbon,
and was mostly open in the back, and I asked her 
about her spring break. She didn't do 
the walking poem exercise, but she played
with her dog. 
She filed out ahead of me and I got the feeling
that there was so much to say, or no, 
there was so little to say but the words 
weren't there to say it, but not that,  
because the words are here, now, 
but never there, 
never in the moment, 
never utterable, such that
if I began speaking I might 
never stop, 
and she would walk away, 
In the same manner, 
I suppose, 
that she did today.
