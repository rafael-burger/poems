Little Dogs

Do those little dogs know
how my friend loathes them? 
I know they don't 
(how could they?),
and I'm glad for it. 

There was a pug
at the beach yesterday, 
no larger than a football,
that seemed generally unaware
of its size and of its stature
and of most things, really,
except for bucket from which
a food-like smell was wafting 
about fifteen feet to the Northwest. 

Unfortunately, the pug was on a six
or seven foot leash, but fortunately, 
its owner was walking in the Nortwestern direction. 

I looked away, so I don't know what happened next,
but I think sometimes that to be 
a little dog would be a virtue.
