The transition from what was 
to what is 
is hard to catch. 

Listen for it, maybe. 
Or feel. 
Anything but sight. 
Sight is such an instantaneous thing,
how could it capture any real delta?

Only flashes in the pan. 
Only frenchmen who refuse to visit the United States,
because they hate America. 

I don't know why that got to me. 
Probably because I'm American,
and I don't think I'm worth hating. 

But I should remember that I am not America,
and America is not me. 

And that frenchman does not exist. 
He exists in the words that were spoken to me and 
so he does not exist at all. 
He exists on another continent
and on another timescale,
and I will never encounter him again except for in my thoughts,
like this. 

Is that the same as not existing? 
    ? 
        ? 

For free, for fire, 
In trees and tires. 
The science spurs forward
the work of our words. 
I worry that's all it does. 

And in quiet moments, I remember you. 
Singing softly, speaking truth. 
You said: 
    The way I weave allows all the fibers 
    to work together.
    And the cloth is stronger.
    The way I weave entwines northward with westward,
        southward with eastward.
    There's a reason they used to say that
    every road leads to Rome. 
    And it's not because Rome was so well connected.
    It's because every non-parallel line intersects. 
    The western winds roll around to the east,
    and the lions bask in the sun,
    and they lick on the heads of their young ones,
    and soon they will rot and will fertilize the soil,
    and the sun will continue to rise because
    it doesn't know about lions 
    or young ones or soil.
