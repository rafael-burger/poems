American Airlines Flight 2157 to Dallas Fort Worth

Forgive me, father. Recently,
sunsets last too long, 
get reflected in the plane's wings and 
look like something else: 
a childhood, 
a chipped painting. 
Some people miss the green in each evening.
The ring between sun and sky, 
between yellow and blue.
A feeling like the spots of lichen 
on the old trees, 
a green like lavender stalks and lambs ears,
Fading quickly and speaking frantically outward
before plunging below the surface,
saying something about repetition. 
Usually I have to squint but from here
it is clearer. 
I wish I could live up here. 
High enough to ensure that you'll feel terminal velocity. 
Promising that, at some point, you'll die trying. 
It doesn't ask about what you were trying for. 

Forgive me, father. I know
this isn't how these things usually go. 
I think I just wanted to talk to someone
that doesn't know me. To ask why
the clouds become harsh after the light retreats,
about how eager they seem to become hard, 
to become stone. 
Stone like the seashore up north
that will cut you so please
don't try anything stupid. 
Don't forget that those who swim out drown. 
Don't forget how far down it goes. 

Forgive me, father. I don't know how to speak
to the people I meet. 
Their words sound like gravel crunching up the driveway.
