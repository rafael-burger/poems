The plastic heats up in the sun and we 
as boys
would hold our hands to it to see 
who was toughest.
Our palms were scalded red 
and where in one moment the table was hot,
in the next moment it was just warm. 
And thus we learned of depletion;
And thus we learned that things grow thin. 

And we grew up and we 
forgot each other and 
we forgot the hot 
tables onto which we were all partially melted, and
bit by bit, 
we ourselves trickled away,
like heat from the source.
