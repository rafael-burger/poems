The hard men in the movies say, 
With so much at stake, 
That there is no in-between
when it comes to things like a poem 
or a gunfight or roping a bronco. 
Squeeze the trigger and mean it, 
or leave it holstered. 
Hold the jagged line tightly, 
or let the beast go. 
An itchy finger, 
A half-hearted grip, 
A lie:
All failures.
