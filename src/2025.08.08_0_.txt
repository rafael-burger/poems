Shallow, golden, and gone
are the rays of sunlight in the water.
Water is 
the thing of life 
and it washes over me warm. 
And the sun is slipping away from where I can see it. 
It is saying something about time.
And it is gone and I am trying to remember the sounds it made. 
Understanding might be easy,
but hearing (hearing!) is hard in hindsight. 
And, as such, I can't hear a thing 
except the      
    (tink)  
        (tink)  
            (tink)
of water droplets onto a copper pot.
 
Every miracle of every morning, 
every sunrise I've never seen
still seems so familiar.
Familiar like light through leaves, 
like the smell of dirt
and of open windows.
Like a rainstorm and
a windy day. 
Like hot dry air
rolling up off the asphalt.
Like the smell of sweat and gasoline. 
Like me telling you that I love you,
and like you begging me not to lie. 

We burn our buildings, 
replace our cogs. 
The things we make
march (on and on).
They root and grow deep
and cannot be taken out cleanly,
no matter how hard
or how gently
you try.
