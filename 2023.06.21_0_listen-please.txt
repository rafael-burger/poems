Listen, please. 

Like that plant on your windowsill, this will die. 
Already, it wilts, and you say not a word. 
I promise you:
She will forget your hand clasped in hers, 
and she will forget what she saw all those miles ago,
when she gazed at you
and you pretended not to notice her watching because you could tell she was smiling
and you did not want her to stop. 
You will forget her warmth in your arms,
and you will forget her laugh washing over you,  
though it felt like water on your neck. 
It kept you alive and you will not remember. 
In silence, your silence, this will die.

Abel and TikTok Cain

You told me that you did not want to lose my friendship, 
and I told you not to worry,
but I am afraid I should not have said that, 
because when I see you I feel upside down.
You joke, and I try to smile, but
the corners of my mouth don't remember which way to go.
I fear that I can not forgive. 
So go, once-friend, away from me. 
Chase what you are chasing;
I am no great thing to lose.

Avatar: The Way of Water

For the IMAX price of 24.99, 
You can sit in one of the rows and rows of plastic seats
next to your friends and next to people you have never seen. 
You will probably never see them again, though you can never be sure about that kind of thing. 
They look beautiful as you walk by and you nod hello, hoping they understand.

Air

You are the air and I have been underwater.
It is clear, and tastes cold, but the water weighs heavy on my shoulders, 
and my lungs are beginning to ache. 
It is hard, now, to marvel at the rounded rocks below, 
or at the trout wiggling past, 
or the twigs that twirl in the eddies they leave at the surface. 
Harder, at least, than it was when I first dove in. 
Engulf me, please, so that I may breathe again.

In The Dark

Your hand is tangled in my collar.
Your breath is hot on my neck as you whisper
I know, baby. It's okay. It's okay.
Your words
pour across my scalp and onto my neck, 
As cold as the ocean and as sticky as sap. 
I reach into my memory
And pull out two containers: 
A plastic bucket and a mason jar. 
I will siphon into the bucket 
Your ocean 
(Whose rip-current pulls me into the dark),
And I will collect in the jar
Each drop of your sap 
(Whose sugars diffuse now into my brainstem).
I promise
I will try my hardest not to let them mix, 
Though I fear they are the same.

Dew

She is wind between leaves. 
She is water. 
Rain. 
A hard, heavy sky that that crashes onto your cheeks
More gently than you can bear
And sweeter than you deserve. 
She is the river, 
Hellbent on washing your banks out to sea. 
Now she is gone, and you are too, 
And there is nothing to give but thanks.

A Storm  

She is wind between leaves. 
She is water. 
Rain. 
A dark, heavy sky that that crashes onto your cheeks
Harder than you can bear
And sweeter than you deserve. 
She is the river, 
Hellbent on washing your banks out to sea. 
Now that she is gone, you are too,  
And there is nothing to give but thanks.
