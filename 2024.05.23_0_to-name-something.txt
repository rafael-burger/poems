To name something is to lie

The only rattlesnake I ever passed never make a sound, 
just laid there curled
like a heap of rope or a child. 
July follows June (as expected) 
and the clouds move
and the child doesn't. 
The hard red trail bakes
under the arcing sun like adobe
and absorbs everything
that we leave behind. 
Boots pass by, and the child,
the rattler, does not rattle.
