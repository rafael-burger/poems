Monospace Nonsense Block Poem

Transcendentalists claim airily and 
without a care, that the woods form
the forge-flame around which we all
might glow. Flow fly (try) circling
crows. Low cry, quiet, startled and
froze. And you, darling mine, stars
and swine, all must know, that tree
trunks together trail, bale, in the 
evergreen gale, and finally, freeze
and are closed. Same as that flower
studded crown of the queen, same as
those lovers who lie and are green,
green with guilt and with pride and
with chest-piercing wealth, same as
the wine bottle up on the shelf. If
you are mine and I am yours there's
so much time to learn these chords.
