Inversion

I never killed something
I didn't want dead, except 
that succulent the summer before last.
I gave it water and was afraid it would die
so I gave it more, and then 
its skin broke and it turned soft
so it couldn't bounce back 
when I poked it. 
It was like jam or honey and suddenly it 
sunk and seeped all over
and into everything else just like 
water.
It was like jam or honey and suddenly water
sinking and seeping all over 
into everything else.
Dripping from the eaves.
Water is stuck in my head, 
you know by now. 
I was swimming in the green and heard a wet crunch 
in my ear drum. 
I knew what had happened so I learned to
head stand and to hand stand but 
no inversion will get it out. 
The word pools in the concave of my skull
and sloshes, heavy like sleep 
or a promise, 
so I say it again and again. 
A prayer, maybe - I wouldn't know.
