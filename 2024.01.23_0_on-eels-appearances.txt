On Eels, Appearances, Etc. 


Scene: common, dull, or a net. Last one stranded,
A soup of rats who impart: my vices will pay, so
stay the hog, yeti, eel. Lure or seek not, for care re-
pays who appear in detail. 

See the common resting hall, I'll be a 'roaming, 
leering, chawing on all the bruschetta (lumps pile up). 
Come pray, dad, in lieu of greeting Benvolio. Record our hate, 
perchance. To sleep is saner. 

Come May, new life puts soul so plainly. Raid hell (Ottawa) for me. 
Princes in Nile vow, airily, 
Sun knows less light than we. From torn
poor blends, each of you are soon woven vests, your own destiny. 
Deal, oh meanie, the steps for rotting. Tear and leak, you rude moray.
