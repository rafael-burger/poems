I've got to call this something

I'm calling it
something new
even though it feels
so familiar. 

I'm calling it
an ending of things, 
because every thing seems always
to be in a process of ending. 

I'm calling it
a beginning
though I fear 
that I'm lying 
to someone. 

I'm calling it 
by her name, 
which is difficult
now
to stomach.

I want to call it 
a beginning, 
but know that I'd be lying 
to someone. 

I called it by his name yesterday
and by her name today, 
which feels right, 
because they'll be gone soon too.
