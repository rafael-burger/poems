I watch a memory of a purple and yellow
bouncy ball.
I am calm and my memory self isn't. 
He must be 8 years old. 
The ball bounces into the street,
the boy chases it, 
the ball rolls down the slope, 
the boy chases it.

And on and on. 


I feel like the ball.
Like something placed at the top
of an impossible large hill. 


A child's grasp fails him
and I begin to roll. 

Here! begins something that will never end. 
Each day, the faces I know 
blur,
and I am afraid 
I will never be found again.
