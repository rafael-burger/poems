Letting go

His hips and his legs were like banshees, tonight, 
whose tongues had been cut out (screeching was off the table). 
Instead, they frothed and flowed, smooth as the surf, 
anything to atone for such silence. 
Isn't that odd? 
Such silence, after all, would disappear in a room as desperate to deafen itself as this one. 
I suppose one finds themselves louder with eyes closed. His eyes opened for a moment,  
and he remembered, relieved: there's not much to do now but dance.
