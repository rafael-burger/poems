Lifeboats

Steel does not bend 
as easily as aluminum does, 
but, given the right persuasion, 
it will. 

She is sitting across the room
and looking down at her computer
and her bangs are falling perfectly, 
and her lips make me want
things I shouldn't, 
and when she looks at me, 
I crumple 
like one of the starboard compartments 
of the RMS Titanic.

My chest rips open to receive
the promise ensured 
by her North Atlantic - 
the promise 
that this is all 
that will ever be - 
and it feels, 
as the lifeboats deploy, 
strangely similar 
to salvation.
