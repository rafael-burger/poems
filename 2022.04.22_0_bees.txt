Bees
Rafael Burger

He and I prance deeper into the shadow of those great green mountains.
The wind whisks our lungs and our minds away. 
Only footprints and droplets linger to tell the tale of where we've been. And they'll be gone soon too. 
Up, up, up we go - it's amazing how high you can climb without leaving the foothills. It's better this way.  
From those heavenly slopes, there'd be nowhere to go but down. 
A golden buzzing builds in my ears and in my brain until I can't take it anymore, 
and I'm tap tap tapping on Xoaquin's back like a child at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
That man is like the mountains. Slow, and steady, and 
unwilling to change for anything but the wind and the rain. And a swarm of bees, apparently, 
Because he soon gets the message, and we're avalanching down the trail. 
But I'm sorry, my brother, the wind is whipping as it would if we were on the heights, 
and I can't hear our friendship over it.
Things fade into each other. His footfalls into the buzzing, and the buzzing into the whispering wind.
