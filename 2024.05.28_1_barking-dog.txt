Barking Dog

Twenty feet down and to the right, 
a dog barks, pleading and praying and 
not realizing
that the damage is done. 
Or it really wants the steak its
owner has just finished grilling, who knows?
It's dinner time, after all, 
and it smells like barbecue, 
and I can't see shit past the curtain of leaves
in that direction.
I'd like to know what that dog can't
shut the fuck up about. 
Could be anything,
like the father today who
died trying
to save his drowning child. 
The child died regardless, and the newspaper
thought I should know, and they dragged them
from the surf when they should have
let them float out. 
And the dog's bark sounds now
like mourning even though
it wasn't there (like me) and even though
it can't read (unlike me) but anyways it 
knows because the sun is below the horizon
and the land is two souls lighter.
