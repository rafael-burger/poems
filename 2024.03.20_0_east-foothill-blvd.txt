East Foothill Blvd. After Dinner

[6:52] The birds come south in no sensible order. 
Four crows, then a hawk, then 
Another crow, left behind by its flock perhaps, then
Smaller birds with gentler calls. 
They flap, coast, flap over tall grasses and low 
Shrubs and a chain-link fence and the four lanes
Of tinted-windowed sports cars and
Squinting-drivered pick-ups and the median
with just enough dirt for the eucalyptus whose hard leaves
Bumble on the breeze like buoys. 
[7:04] The birds keep coming. Black 
Birds and black 
Planes with propellors buzzing barely over the wind and
A procession of gaunt and gray and gradually goldening
Clouds traipsing from the iron horizon. 
[7:09] A clack-clack of board-wheels from two young men
Riding again and again 
Over the same patch of pavement and jumping and twisting and 
Speaking to each other.   
[7:17] A square white building with 
Four stories and tall dark windows and
A ladder up its side that a woman once climbed and 
The long drop down.
[7:22] Mountains with white on their peaks from
Snow that disappears too quickly into rivulets 
To feed the growing streams over which the birds came.
