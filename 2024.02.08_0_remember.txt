Remember: 

Horses racing, 
A storm that shattered glass,
Reaching, reaching,
Panicking when the teacher said something that sounded like your name, 
Walking alone in rain, 
Running, running, 
Water on your face, 
Seeming, not being, 
Meaning, not meaning, 
Listening to talk, 
Water on your neck, 
Talk about painting, 
Talk about film, 
The arrival of a train at the station, 
Thunder and its smack or just	 thunder, 
Fish flopping on the pier, 
Fish becoming tired, 
Painting things blue,  
Beating the rug to get the dust out, 
Closing your eyes to keep the dust out, 
Beating around the bush, 
Banging pots and pans, 
Piling wood for winter, 
Closing doors, 
Closing windows,  
Horses, 
Hail, 
Racing down.
