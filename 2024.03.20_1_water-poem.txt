Water Poem 2024.3.20

Running water, water 
Convecting, water
Swirling, water
Dirty, water
Murky, 
A mire. 
You and I are mired in
Something thick 	and slick 	and which sticks 	in your hair 
So that when you open your mouth to speak	it is there 
Upon you	and in you	and around in the air and
You burn	burn. 
Water, water. Drowning, drowning,
Water drowning, which seems a
Paradox, which seems a
Nonsense way 	for water to die, 
Water to die, which seems a 
Nonsense in itself, 
But remember the		beginning of water, 
So why not		the end of water? 
And remember that		men die to men, 
So why not		water to water?
