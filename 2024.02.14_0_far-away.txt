Far away

A song you don't know 
But which sounds familiar. 

Transmission line towers
Which grow small toward the horizon
And whose lines bounce around in the west-blowing wind.
Transmission line towers which make no sound. 

The sun which hangs heavy
And casts tired long shadows
Which gyre and dance as they darken. 
The sun which repaints the sky.

A coyote's moonshine eyes
Which glint and are gone. 

A river in the woods
You can hear but not see.
