Cicada Song

Like taffy in an old time candy factory, bits of shade
Became thin as they stretched and
It was suddenly hard 
to tell between what was yours and
What was mine and
What was neither of ours. 
A cicada song, to begin with. One that
I couldn't name but that I thought 
You had shown me once (you hadn't, 
You said, as dust and brittle grass
Vibrated, as if they both knew what we were
Talking about, as if they were laughing
at our silliness, as if they were dancing
To tune all around us, which, with each passing day
Faded further into the swishing grass).
